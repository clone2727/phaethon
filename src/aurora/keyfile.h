/** Class to hold resource index information of a KEY file.
 *
 *  A KEY file is one part of the KEY/BIF resource archive system.
 *  The KEY file contains the resource names and types, and the BIF
 *  file contains the actual resource data. So KEY files only contain
 *  the resource meta-data.
 *
 *  A KEY file can index resources of several BIF files and several
 *  BIF files can in turn index different resources of the same BIF
 *  file.
 *
 *  Additionally, there are BZF files. A BZF is a compressed variation
 *  of a BIF file, found exclusively in the iOS version of Knights of
 *  the Old Republic.
 *
 *  See also classes BIFFile in biffile.h and BZFFile in bzffile.h.
 *
 *  There are two versions of KEY files known and supported
 *  - V1, used by Neverwinter Nights, Neverwinter Nights 2, Knight of
 *    the Old Republic, Knight of the Old Republic II and Jade Empire
 *  - V1.1, used by The Witcher
 *
 *  Please note that KEY (and BIF) files found in Infinity Engine
 *  games (Baldur's Gate et al) are not supported at all, even though
 *  they claim to be V1.
